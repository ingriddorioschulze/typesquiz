Simple Trivia Quiz built with Typescript, React, Open Trivia Database API and Styled Components.

The application initiates with a start button and the user can see the first question. Answering the question correctly will display the answer with the color green and update the score with one point.

Presenting a wrong answer will show the color red and point the correct answer in green. Clicking the "next question" button will display the next question until the round ends.
